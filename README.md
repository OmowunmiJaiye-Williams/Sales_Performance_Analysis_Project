# Sales_Performance_Analysis_Project

## Project Overview

This data analysis project, conducted as part of LITA capstone project, aims to uncover insights into the sales performance of a retail store over the years 2023 and 2024. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, I seek to identify trends and evaluate performance across different regions. The goal is to make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the store’s overall performance during this period.
 
## Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is “sales_data.csv,” which includes detailed information about each sale made by the retail store.

## Tools
- Excel: Data Cleaning and Initial Exploration.
  - Used Excel for initial data exploration, data summarization using pivot tables, and calculations.

- SQL Server: Data Quering and Analytics.
  
- PowerBi: Data Visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:

  - What are the total sales for each product category?
  -  How many sales transactions occurred in each region?
  -  Which product had the highest total sales value?
  -  What is the total revenue generated per product?
  -  What are the monthly sales totals for the current year?
  -  Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase amount?
  -  What percentage of total sales is contributed by each region?
  - Which products had no sales in the last quarter?

 ## Project Steps/Data Analysis
**Excel: Data Exploration and Analysis**
Overview of Excel Analysis: 
In this phase of the project, I conducted an initial exploration of the sales data using Excel, focusing on key metrics to gain insights into the retail store's performance. The first step was to derive meaningful insights from the dataset by examining trends over time.

**Extracting Month from Dates**: Before creating my pivot tables, I extracted the month from the 'OrderDate' column in the dataset. 

In the first cells under the Months column, enter

``` =MONTH(OrderDate) ```

This allowed me to focus on how sales varied from month to month, highlighting periods of peak performance or potential downturns. By analyzing sales data on a monthly basis, I could identify seasonal patterns and fluctuations that might not be apparent when looking at the data in aggregate.

**Monthly Sales Totals**: With the month data extracted, I analyzed monthly sales totals to understand sales trends over the years. This analysis was crucial for identifying peak sales months.

**Total Sales by Product Category**: I created a pivot table to analyze total sales across different products. This helped identify which products contributed most to overall sales.
