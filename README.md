# Sales_Performance_Analysis_Project


## Executive Summary
This data analysis project, conducted as part of the LITA capstone program, transforms raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. By analyzing sales data from 2023 and 2024, the project aims to identify key trends, top-performing products and regions, and valuable customer segments to drive strategic decision-making for a retail business. The goal is to provide clear, data-driven recommendations that directly impact business growth and efficiency.

## ‚ùìBusiness Problem
A retail business needs to understand its sales performance to make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing, and future strategies. This project addresses the following key questions:

- Which products are the top performers in terms of sales?

- What are the sales trends and performance across different regions?

- Who are the most valuable customers, and what does their purchasing behavior reveal?

The goal is to provide clear, data-driven recommendations that can directly impact business growth and efficiency.

## üìà Process
**1. Data Preparation & Cleaning:** Performed in Excel and Power Query; handled formatting inconsistencies and prepared data for analysis.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used Excel Pivot Tables to uncover initial trends in sales over time, by product, and by region.

**3. Data Analysis:** Wrote complex SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and answer critical business questions.

**4. Data Visualization:** Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to present findings in an accessible and visually compelling way.


## Key Insights
**My analysis of the sales data revealed several critical insights that a business could use for strategic planning:**

- **Product Performance:** The analysis confirmed that Shoes were the top-performing product, generating 3,087,500 in total sales, while the South region led in overall sales contribution. This suggests that the store should focus on maintaining a high inventory of shirts and explore the factors contributing to the South region's strong performance to replicate that success elsewhere.

- **Consistent Sales Transactions:** The analysis shows a consistent number of sales transactions across all regions, with each region contributing exactly 25% of the total, or approximately 360 sales transactions. This indicates a strong market presence and balanced customer engagement throughout the store's operational areas.

- **Customer Value:** The project identified the top customers by their purchasing behavior, highlighting the importance of understanding consumer spending patterns. For example,the top 6 customers generated a significant portion of the total revenue, approximately 6.3% ($669,875 out of $10,587,500). This insight is crucial for developing targeted marketing campaigns and loyalty programs to reward these high-value customers and increase their share of revenue.

- **Incomplete Data Limitation:** The dataset is missing sales data for the last quarter of 2024 (October to December) because the period is ongoing. This limitation impacts the ability to analyze complete yearly trends and conduct accurate year-over-year comparisons or forecasting for the full year.


## üõ†Ô∏èTechnical Approach & Tools Used
**This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow, from initial exploration to final visualization.**

- **Excel:** I used Excel for initial data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. This included using pivot tables to summarize sales data and gain an initial understanding of product and regional performance.

- **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server):** The dataset was then loaded into SQL Server, where I wrote queries to perform deeper analysis. This step demonstrated my ability to query and analyze data from a database, confirming initial findings and extracting more specific details about sales trends.

- **Power BI:** I used Power BI to transform the data and create an interactive dashboard. The data transformation included cleaning the data and ensuring correct data types. The final visualization provides a clear and interactive view of the key findings, allowing stakeholders to easily explore sales trends and product performance.



## üìä Interactive Dashboard
This Power BI dashboard synthesizes all analyses into a single, interactive view for stakeholders to explore the data and insights dynamically.

This visualization effectively addresses our insights and exploratory data analysis (EDA) questions, providing a clear representation of the key findings derived from the sales data.



## Conclusion & Business Impact
This project demonstrates my ability to translate technical data analysis into a compelling business narrative. The findings provide clear, actionable recommendations for multiple departments:

- Inventory & Operations: The analysis provides data to support decisions on which products to prioritize in inventory.

- Marketing & Sales: The insights on regional performance and top customers can inform targeted sales campaigns and customer engagement strategies.

- Strategy & Planning: The project serves as a foundational analysis for future sales forecasting and business growth initiatives, despite the limitation of incomplete data.
